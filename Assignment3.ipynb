    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans. 1. Reusability\n",
    "     2. Redability and maintainability\n",
    "     3. Testing and debugging\n",
    "     4. Modularity : Functions helps to break down a complex problem into simple pieces\n",
    "     5. Code organisation and reusability\n",
    "     6. Abstraction\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "Ans. The code inside the function runs when we call it not when it is defined. The code inside the function is a reusable block which can be executed when it is called.\n",
    "eg - def name(firstname)\n",
    "     print(\"Hello\" + firstname)\n",
    "name(\"ineuron\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Ans. Functions in python can be created using def statement followed by function name, a pair of paranthesis which contains option parameters followed by a colon which defines the start of the block code.\n",
    "def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans. Function is a reusable block that performs a specific task and a list of operations. It contains a code or sequence of lines of code to perform a specific task. It can also input parameters and can optionally return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function call executes a specific function at a particular point in the program. When you call a function, you use its name followed by parentheses, optionally passing arguments inside the parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg - def name(firstname):\n",
    "         print(\"Hello\" + name)\n",
    "    #function definition : 'name' is defined as a function\n",
    "    name(\"iNeuron\")\n",
    "    #function call : 'name' function is called with 'iNeuron' as an argument. \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans. Python program has one global scope that remains accessible throughout the program whereas each function has its own local scope that is created when the function is called and destroyed when the execution is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans. When the function call returns in python the local scope is destroyed and hence the variable within that local scope does not exists. This proceas ia known as variable cleanup or garbage collection. \n",
    "If we try to call that variable it will give us 'NameError'.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans. By returning values from functions, you can create reusable and modular code that performs specific computations and produces results that can be utilized in different parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is not possible to have return value directly in an expression. The return statement itself is a statement, not an expression. It does not produce a value that can be directly used within an expression or assigned to a variable in the middle of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans. If a function does not have a return statement or if it reaches the end of the function without including a return statement, the function will return 'None'in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value or the lack of a return value. It is commonly used to indicate that a function does not return anything meaningful or when the result is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans. For the function variable refer to the global variable we can use 'global' as a keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "eg - \n",
    "x = 10 #global variable\n",
    "def update_x_value():\n",
    "    global x #using global keyword to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "    x = 20 \n",
    "print(x) #output 10\n",
    "update_x_value()\n",
    "print(x) #output 20\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans. None represents the absence of a value when we call any function. None belongs to built-in class NoneType. \n",
    "Hence the data type of None is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Ans. It is not a valid import statement. Hence it would result ModuleNotFoundError.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Ans. import spam\n",
    "     spam.bacon()\n",
    "     \n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Ans. To prevent a programme from crashing we can use error handling techniques to catch and handle exceptions. This can be achieved using try and except statements. \n",
    "Eg - \n",
    "try :\n",
    "   #code that may throw an error\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "   #code to handle the exception\n",
    "   \n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans. The purpose of the try clause is to have the block of code that may raise an exception. The code within the try block is executed and if any exception occurs it will immediately moves to the except block.\n",
    "The purpose of the except clause is define how to handle specific types of exception that might occur with the corresponding try block. "
